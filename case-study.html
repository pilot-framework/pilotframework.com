        <h2 class="h2">1 Introduction</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          TODO: this needs to be changed / modified to be more Pilot-y.
          The last decade has seen a paradigm shift in computing infrastructure. Systems are becoming more and more
          ephemeral, abstracted, and distributed. Innovations in computing infrastructure and software architectures
          have yielded simpler components at higher levels of abstraction, but behind those simpler pieces lurk more
          complex systems. Engineers are able to deploy and stitch together many more different kinds of software
          components today, resulting in vastly increased complexity. As individual nodes in your system’s topology
          become more decentralized, they also become more complicated to track and monitor.
        </p>

        <h3>1.1 What is Pilot?</h3>
        <p>
          Pilot is an open-source, multi-cloud framework that provisions an internal PaaS with a workflow-agnostic
          build, deploy, and release pipeline. Our team built Pilot in order to help small teams tackle the challenges
          of adopting a multi-cloud strategy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Pilot enables you to deploy, manage, and quickly iterate upon your applications regardless of the complexity
          of the underlying architecture. With Pilot, you don't have to learn the specifics of a certain service offered
          by a cloud provider - such as Amazon Web Service's Elastic Container Service. You can simply give Pilot some
          cursory information about your application, and Pilot will handle the rest. The same goes for other cloud providers,
          such as Google Cloud Platform. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All of this allows developers to quickly get an application up and running on their desired cloud provider without
          having to trawl through pages and pages of documentation or learn the ins-and-outs of how that cloud provider works.
        </p>
        <br />

        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <h2 class="h2">2 Multi-Cloud Strategy</h2>
        <h3>2.1 ACME: An Example User Story</h3>
        <p>
          To discuss the adoption of a multi-cloud strategy, let's use an example company ACME. ACME's application is currently
          a monolithic application - all business logic is handled within the same code-base. And in ACME's case, on a bare-metal
          server that they own. This has been ACME's tried and true approach for awhile now; however, this infrastructure has limits.
          With a single server, they're limited by physical bottlenecks like the server's memory and networking capabilities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <figure>
          <img src="assets/images/case-study/monolith_1.png" class="case-study-image" />
          <figcaption>Fig. 1: TODO</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>
          Because of this, ACME's CTO has been working on their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_transformation" target="_blank"> digital transformation</a>
          plans. As part of their digital transformation, the CTO has informed the development team of the two most important goals:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            breaking apart their monolith into microservices
          </li>
          <li>
            adopting a multi-cloud, or hybrid cloud, strategy
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>2.2 Breaking Apart a Monolith</h3>
        <p>
          If we look at their monolithic application in more detail, we can see that they've got some distinct, logical services
          already - in a monolith, these could be classes in an object-oriented language, but otherwise they are just portions of
          the code-base with a distinct responsibility.
        </p>
        <br />
        <figure>
          <img src="assets/images/case-study/monolith_2.png" class="case-study-image" />
          <figcaption>Fig. 2: TODO</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>
          Adopting a microservice approach would mean that rather than portions of the same code-base, services are discrete and are
          only concerned with their own processes while still being able to communicate with other services. One of the primary benefits
          of this approach is that it allows services to scale and consume resources independently of one another.
        </p>
        <br />
        <figure>
          <img src="assets/images/case-study/microservice_1.png" class="case-study-image" />
          <figcaption>Fig. 3: TODO</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <h3>2.3 Adopting a Multi-Cloud Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          A multi-cloud strategy means utilizing services provided by multiple cloud providers. There are many reasons a company might
          adopt this approach, but some common ones are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            avoiding single-vendor lock-in
          </li>
          <li>
            operational resiliency
          </li>
          <li>
            security and governance
          </li>
          <li>
            emerging technologies
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Because of this, many companies have already adopted a multi-cloud strategy[1]. However, adopting this strategy can be difficult,
          especially for smaller companies. Common inhibitors for teams are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            lack of in-house skills
          </li>
          <li>
            hybrid cloud complexity
          </li>
          <li>
            complexity of networking
          </li>
          <li>
            lack of tooling
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Many small companies also utilize a <i>Platform-as-a-Service</i>, which typically don't provide the flexibility needed for
          multi-cloud deployments.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <h2 class="h2">3 Platform-as-a-Service</h2>

        <h3>3.1 ACME: Service Extraction</h3>
        <p>
          Now that we're familiar with ACME's digital transformation plans, let's see how their development team would go about
          implementing these changes. The first thing they're going to do is identify which service to extract out of the monolith.
          They want their users to be able to log in to 3rd party websites with their ACME accounts; however, this means that a lot
          of requests coming in <i>just</i> for authentication could degrade their overall application's performance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <figure>
          <img src="assets/images/case-study/monolith_3.png" class="case-study-image" />
          <figcaption>Fig. 4: TODO</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>
          To solve this, they'll extract the auth service out of the monolith, and they'll want to deploy it where the service will be
          highly available. With that in mind, let's take a look at what the deployment pipeline could look like with a multi-cloud approach.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>3.2 Deployment Pipeline</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="assets/images/case-study/deployment_pipeline.png" class="case-study-image" />
          <figcaption>Fig. 5: TODO</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>
          First, a software development team plans, architects, and develops an application.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Then, the source code goes through some sort of build process to produce a runnable artifact. That could be containerizing
          the application to provide a slim, low-footprint environment for the application to execute in using Docker. Or, it could be
          compiling code from a frontend framework like React into static files using a package manager like Yarn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The artifact from the build phase is then used as the application is deployed to the proper hosting solution. There are many
          solutions out there: such as Google Cloud Run for container orchestration, AWS EC2 for virtual machines, and AWS S3 for static file hosting.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Finally, any necessary resources for public consumption are configured to interface with an existing deployment - such as setting up an
          application load balancer to direct network traffic, or configuring a content distribution network like AWS Cloudfront to distribute
          static files stored in S3.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All this complexity can be difficult to both learn and manage, especially for small development teams with little DevOps experience.
          This is why Platforms as a Service have arisen.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>3.3 PaaS v. Other Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          A platform-as-a-service, or PaaS, abstracts away the complexity of the build, deploy, and release cycle. This allows developers to simply
          focus on their code. Examples of a PaaS are Heroku, and cloud provider-specific platforms like Google's App Engine and Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When using a PaaS, developers generally trade control and configuration away for ease-of-use. Let's look at PaaS compared to other options,
          like on-premise servers and Infrastructure-as-a-Service.
        </p>
        <br />
        <figure>
          <img src="assets/images/case-study/paas_compare.png" class="case-study-image" />
          <figcaption>Fig. 6: TODO</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>
          With on-premise servers, you have the most control and configurability of your environment - from your application all the way down to
          the bare-metal server - however, with that comes a lot of responsibility. With physical servers come physical maintenance - ensuring your
          server room is properly ventilated and secured are very important to ensuring your services remain stable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Next, there is Infrastructure-as-a-Service, or IaaS. As the name implies, the service you're paying for is the management and control of
          those physical servers. You no longer need the overhead of a server room and maintenance, simply spin up a virtual machine and go from there.
          However, for simply deploying an application, there's still a lot of management and configuration overhead.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This is why PaaS exists - developers can concern themselves with their applications and data, while the platform handles the infrastructure under the hood.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>3.4 Internal PaaS</h3>
        <p>
          Let's revisit the auth service ACME wants to deploy. They're allowing their users to log in to 3rd party websites with their ACME accounts; however, they know
          it needs to be highly available since they can't predict the usage patterns of that 3rd party website.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          ACME has decided they want to use a PaaS for ease-of-use. They've decided on Google's App Engine, which will handle the build, deploy, and release cycle for
          their auth service. Under the hood, Google uses their own Cloud Run container orchestrator - which is known to be highly available and scalable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But now, ACME has another issue. As part of their payment logic, they process payment data, generate invoices, and store them on a local file server. However,
          their local file server is running out of disk space, and they don't want to keep buying hard drives.
        </p>
        <br />
        <figure>
          <img src="assets/images/case-study/monolith_5.png" class="case-study-image" />
          <figcaption>Fig. 7: TODO</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>
          While they could utilize Google's Cloud Storage, they don't want to get locked in to a single vendor so early on in their service extraction process - so,
          they've decided to migrate their files to Amazon's S3. However, this also means they need to modify their payment service.
        </p>
        <br />
        <figure>
          <img src="assets/images/case-study/monolith_6.png" class="case-study-image" />
          <figcaption>Fig. 8: TODO</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>
          They've decided to design a data pipeline - the application will send invoice data to an AWS Lambda, which will perform any pre-processing before sending
          it to Firehose, which then streams it into their S3 buckets. As you can see below, with just two services extracted, the application topology is beginning to become
          more and more complex. They've got one service running on Google Cloud Run via App Engine, and their data pipeline on AWS.
        </p>
        <br />
        <figure>
          <img src="assets/images/case-study/monolith_6.png" class="case-study-image" />
          <figcaption>Fig. 9: TODO: REPLACE</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br />
        <p>
          The development team at ACME is getting frustrated with the separated deployment pipelines, and wish they could manage all of this in a unified platform - they've seen
          companies build their own platform before and are toying with the idea themselves.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Companies like Netflix[2] and Atlassian[3] <i>have</i> built their own platforms. The reasoning behind that is as you initially set up IaaS offerings, you think that managing them will
          be as simple as setting up some load balancers and pointing them to an autoscaling group of virtual machines, which have access to your resources.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However the reality is that, especially as your application grows, this topology becomes increasingly complex to manage. It's difficult to track down exactly which
          application is running on which resource, which deployments may be stale and ready to tear down, and overall takes a dedicated team to truly manage
          in an efficient manner. Both Netflix and Atlassian are large enterprises that can afford to dedicate teams to their platforms - ACME <i>isn't</i>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          And <i>that</i> is why we built Pilot - a tool that can assist small development teams without the resources and expertise that
          larger companies might have at their disposal to tackle complex multi-cloud deployments.
        </p>
